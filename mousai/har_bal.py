    r"""Harmonic balance solver for first and second order ODEs.

    Obtains the solution of a first-order and second-order differential
    equation under the presumption that the solution is harmonic using an
    algebraic time method.

    Returns `t` (time), `x` (displacement), `v` (velocity), and `a`
    (acceleration) response of a first- or second- order linear ordinary
    differential equation defined by
    :math:`\ddot{\mathbf{x}}=f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\omega)` or
    :math:`\dot{\mathbf{x}}=f(\mathbf{x},\omega)`.

    For the state space form, the function `sdfunc` should have the form::

        def duff_osc_ss(x, params):  # params is a dictionary of parameters
            omega = params['omega']  # `omega` will be put into the dictionary
                                     # for you
            t = params['cur_time']   # The time value is available as
                                     # `cur_time` in the dictionary
            xdot = np.array([[x[1]],[-x[0]-.1*x[0]**3-.1*x[1]+1*np.sin(omega*t)]])
            return xdot

    In a state space form solution, the function must accept the states and the
    `params` dictionary. This dictionary should be used to obtain the
    prescribed response frequency and the current time. These plus any other
    parameters are used to calculate the state derivatives which are returned
    by the function.

    For the second order form the function `sdfunc` should have the form::

        def duff_osc(x, v, params):  # params is a dictionary of parameters
            omega = params['omega']  # `omega` will be put into the dictionary
                                     # for you
            t = params['cur_time']   # The time value is available as
                                     # `cur_time` in the dictionary
            return np.array([[-x-.1*x**3-.2*v+np.sin(omega*t)]])

    In a second-order form solution the function must take the states and the
    `params` dictionary. This dictionary should be used to obtain the
    prescribed response frequency and the current time. These plus any other
    parameters are used to calculate the state derivatives which are returned
    by the function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sdfunc : function
        For `eqform='first_order'`, name of function that returns **column
        vector** first derivative given `x`, and a dictionry of parameters.
        This is *NOT* a string (not the name of the function).

        :math:`\dot{\mathbf{x}}=f(\mathbf{x},\omega)`

        For `eqform='second_order'`, name of function that returns **column
        vector** second derivative given `x`, `v`, and a dictionary of
        parameters. This is *NOT* a string.

        :math:`\ddot{\mathbf{x}}=f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\omega)`
    x0 : array_like, somewhat optional
        n x m array where n is the number of equations and m is the number of
        values representing the repeating solution.
        It is required that :math:`m = 1 + 2 num_{harmonics}`. (we will
        generalize allowable default values later.)
    omega : float
        assumed fundamental response frequency in radians per second.
    method : str, optional
        Name of optimization method to be used.
    num_harmonics : int, optional
        Number of harmonics to presume. The omega = 0 constant term is always
        presumed to exist. Minimum (and default) is 1. If num_harmonics*2+1
        exceeds the number of columns of `x0` then `x0` will be expanded, using
        Fourier analaysis, to include additional harmonics with the starting
        presumption of zero values.
    num_variables : int, somewhat optional
        Number of states for a state space model, or number of generalized
        dispacements for a second order form.
        If `x0` is defined, num_variables is inferred. An error will result if
        both `x0` and num_variables are left out of the function call.
        `num_variables` must be defined if `x0` is not.
    eqform : str, optional
        `second_order` or `first_order`. (second order is default)
    params : dict, optional
        Dictionary of parameters needed by sdfunc.
    realify : boolean, optional
        Force the returned results to be real.
    other : any
        Other keyword arguments available to nonlinear solvers in
        `scipy.optimize.nonlin
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.nonlin.html>`_.
        See `Notes`.

    Returns
    -------
    t, x, e, amps, phases : array_like
        time, displacement history (time steps along columns), errors,
    amps : float array
        amplitudes of displacement (primary harmonic) in column vector format.
    phases : float array
        amplitudes of displacement (primary harmonic) in column vector format.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import mousai as ms
    >>> t, x, e, amps, phases = ms.hb_time(ms.duff_osc,
    ...                                    np.array([[0,1,-1]]),
    ...                                    omega = 0.7)

       ``hb_freq``

    This method is not reliable for a low number of harmonics.

    Calls a linear algebra function from
    `scipy.optimize.nonlin
    <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.nonlin.html>`_ with
    `newton_krylov` as the default.

    Evaluates the differential equation/s at evenly spaced points in time. Each
    point in time yields a single equation. One harmonic plus the constant term
    results in 3 points in time over the cycle.

    Solver should gently "walk" solution up to get to nonlinearities for hard
    nonlinearities.

    Algorithm:
        1. calls `hb_err` with `x` as the variable to solve for.
        2. `hb_err` uses a Fourier representation of `x` to obtain
           velocities (after an inverse FFT) then calls `sdfunc` to determine
           accelerations.
        3. Accelerations are also obtained using a Fourier representation of x
        4. Error in the accelerations (or state derivatives) are the functional
           error used by the nonlinear algebraic solver
           (default `newton_krylov`) to be minimized by the solver.

    Options to the nonlinear solvers can be passed in by \*\*kwargs (keyword
    arguments) identical to those available to the nonlinear solver.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : array_like
            x is an :math:`n \\times m` by 1 array of presumed displacements.
            It must be a "list" array (not a linear algebra vector). Here
            :math:`n` is the number of displacements and :math:`m` is the
            number of times per cycle at which the displacement is guessed
            (minimum of 3)

        params : dictionary
            Because this function will be called by one of the scipy.optimize
            root finders, it must be a function of only `x`. However, for
            generality it need to be built based on user defined variables.
            These variables must be in the scope of memory when the function is
            created. For conveience they are stored in the variable `params`.

                1. `function`: the function which returns the numerically
                calculated state derivatives (or second derivatives) given the
                states (or states and first derivatives).

                2. `omega`: which is the defined fundamental harmonic
                at which the solution is desired.

                3. `n_har`: an integer representing the number of harmonics.
                Note that `m` above is equal to 1 + 2 * `n_har`.

        Returns
        -------
        e : array_like
            2d array of numerical error of presumed solution(s) `x`.

        Notes
        -----
        `function` and `omega` are not separately defined arguments so as to
        enable algebraic solver functions to call `hb_time_err` cleanly.

        The algorithm is broadly as follows:
            1. The velocity or accelerations are calculated in the same shape
               as `x` as the variables `vel` and `accel`, one column for each
               time step.
            3. Each column of `x` and `v` are sent with `t`, `omega`, and other
               `**kwargs** to `function` with the results
               agregated into the columns of `accel_num`.
            4. The difference between `accel_num` and `accel` or
               `velocity_num` and `velocity` represent the error used
               by the numerical algebraic equation solver.

    The original format for the Mousai derivative function was
    `sdfunc(x, params)`. This is inconsistent with the SciPy integration
    functions. To act more as expected, the standard from 0.4.0 on will take
    the form `sdfunc(x, t, params)`.

    ----------

        function in old Mousai form. `sdfunc(y, params)`
